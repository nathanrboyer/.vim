My personal .vim folder configuration.

Includes plugins by tpope and JuliaEditorSupport which will need to be re-cloned from their respective repositories.

You will need to tell vim that your vimrc file is not in the usual place with either:
* export VIMINIT="source ~/.vim/vimrc"
* ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
